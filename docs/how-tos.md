## How to: get back to a clean slate

If you encounter an issue with your Docker setup and you've already exhausted all other ideas, here's a quick one-liner that stops and removes absolutely everything. You can then follow the govuk-docker README instructions for `make`-ing your app again.

```
docker stop $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rm $(docker ps -a -q) && docker rmi $(docker images -q) -f && docker volume prune && docker container prune && docker image prune && docker network prune && docker build prune -f && docker system prune --all --volumes
```

## How to: reduce typing with shortcuts

Typing the [full commands](../README.md#usage) is likely to get tiring. We've added a couple of lightweight helper scripts alongside govuk-docker, which figure out the application you're running based on the name of the current directory.

```
# full commands
govuk-docker run content-publisher-lite bundle exec rake
govuk-docker up content-publisher-app

# shortcuts
# assuming you're in the content-publisher directory
govuk-docker-run bundle exec rake
govuk-docker-up
```

Here are some suggested aliases that make things even shorter.

```
alias gd="govuk-docker"
alias gdr="govuk-docker-run"
alias gdu="govuk-docker-up"
alias gdbe="govuk-docker-run bundle exec"
```

## How to: work with local gems

Provide a local gem path relative to the location of the Gemfile you're editing:

```ruby
gem "govuk_publishing_components", path: "../govuk_publishing_components"
```

## How to: replicate data locally

There may be times when a full database is required locally.  The following scripts in the `bin` directory allow replicating data from integration:

- `replicate-elasticsearch.sh`
- `replicate-mongodb.sh APP-NAME`
- `replicate-mysql.sh APP-NAME`
- `replicate-postgresql.sh APP-NAME`

You will need to assume-role into AWS using the [gds-cli](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/access-aws-console.html) before running the scripts. For example, to replicate data for Content Publisher, run:

```
# as an AWS PowerUser...
gds aws govuk-integration-poweruser --assume-role-ttl 3h ./bin/replicate-postgresql.sh content-publisher

# as an AWS User...
gds aws govuk-integration-readonly --assume-role-ttl 3h ./bin/replicate-postgresql.sh content-publisher
```

All the scripts, other than `replicate-elasticsearch.sh`, take the name of the app to replicate data for.

Draft data can be replicated with `replicate-postgresql.sh draft-content-store` and `replicate-mongodb.sh draft-router`.

If you want to download data without importing it, set the `SKIP_IMPORT` environment variable (to anything).

### Troubleshooting

The replication scripts might fail for the following reasons:

- `pv` not being installed. This is used to display a progress bar. On macOS, you can [install pv using Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/pv).
- Running out of space in Docker. This might result in an error like `ERROR 1114 (HY000) at line 11768: The table 'govspeak_contents' is full`. If you see this, you could do either or both of the following:
  - If you're okay with removing some or all of your Docker containers, images, and possibly volumes and other data, run [docker system prune](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/system/prune).
  - If you have enough spare space on your local machine, allocate more space to Docker. Using Docker Desktop, this setting is under Settings > Resources > Advanced > Resource Allocation > Virtual disk limit.

## How to: set environment variables

While most environment variables should be set in the config for a project, sometimes it's necessary to set assign one or more variables at the point of running a command, such as a Rake task. This can be done using `env` e.g.

```
govuk-docker run content-publisher-lite env MY_VAR=my_val bundle exec rake my_task
```

## How to: debug a running Rails app

Normally it's enough to run a Rails app using `govuk-docker up`. To get a `debugger` console for a specific app or one of its dependencies, we need to attach an interactive terminal to the running container.

```
# find the container name
govuk-docker ps

# attach to the container
docker attach govuk-docker_content-publisher-app_1

# awesome debugging stuff
...

# detach from the container
CTRL-P CTRL-Q
```

Note that many of the apps run using the Puma web server, which by default runs in cluster mode. This causes problems with using the debugger console. Puma routes the stdout from multiple processes back into the main container stdout, so the effect is often that keystrokes appear to be "lost" while output from non-paused processes is prioritised. To fix this, you can set the `WEB_CONCURRENCY` environment variable on the container to 0. That will force Puma to run in single process mode.

## How to: use a custom working directory

GOV.UK Docker should respect the following environment variables:

- `$GOVUK_ROOT_DIR` - directory where app repositories live, defaults to `$HOME/govuk`
- `$GOVUK_DOCKER_DIR` - directory where the govuk-docker repository lives, defaults to `$GOVUK_ROOT_DIR/govuk-docker`
- `$GOVUK_DOCKER` - path of the govuk-docker script, defaults to `$GOVUK_DOCKER_DIR/bin/govuk-docker`


## How to: enable production JSON logs in development

- Set `GOVUK_RAILS_JSON_LOGGING` to `"true"` in `docker-compose.yml` for the application you would like to enable the logs' behaviour for.

## How to: Re-run `make` without branch checks

If you have already run `make` for a project recently, and just want to re-run it without it
checking for updates to all dependent repositories (for example if you do not have a stable internet
connection), you can set the `SKIP_BRANCH_CHECKS` environment variable:
```bash
SKIP_BRANCH_CHECKS=1 make my-app
```

## How to: Use Podman instead of Docker

> [!WARNING]
> GOV.UK Docker was built for Docker (if the name didn't make that obvious!), so when leaving the
> "golden path" you may experience unexpected issues that your peers can't help you with.
>
> For now, we recommend you only use another Linux container runtime if you are comfortable with
> Linux and container technologies, and able/willing to resolve issues yourself.

If you prefer to use [Podman](https://podman.io/) instead of Docker to run and orchestrate your
containers, you can set `GOVUK_DOCKER_CONTAINER_RUNTIME=podman` in your environment (for example, in
your `.bashrc`).

Podman needs an external "compose provider" installed as a backing tool for `podman compose` (which
itself is just a wrapper), and the ideal option is Docker's v2 Compose CLI plugin rather than the
legacy `podman-compose` tool. You do not need Docker itself installed, and `podman compose` will
pick up on the Docker Compose plugin automatically if installed, for example through:
- Podman Desktop on macOS or Windows
- your Linux distribution's package manager or Homebrew on macOS (check to make sure it's >= 2.x)
- manually installing a release from [its repository](https://github.com/docker/compose)

There are two major gotchas relating to the Nginx proxy:
- it needs to run on port 80, which under most circumstances requires root privileges to bind to on
  Linux, and
- it requires a Docker-compatible socket to be mounted into the container, so is not compatible with
  daemonless approaches (like Podman's out-of-the-box architecture)

The easiest way to work around this is (more advanced approaches are available but left as an
exercise for the reader):
- on Linux, by setting up a Podman socket as root, and running GOV.UK Docker as root
- on Mac, by using Podman Desktop and enabling all Docker Compatibility features

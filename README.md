# govuk-docker

GOV.UK development environment using Docker.

![diagram](docs/diagram.png)

## Introduction

The GOV.UK website is a microservice architecture, formed of many apps working together. Developing in this ecosystem is a challenge, due to the range of environments to maintain, both for the app being developed and its dependencies.

The aim of govuk-docker is to make it easy to develop any GOV.UK app. It achieves this by providing a variety of environments or _stacks_ for each app, in which you can run tests, start a debugger,
publish a document end-to-end e.g.

```
# Run whitehall rake plus any required dependencies (DBs)
whitehall$ govuk-docker run-this default rake

# Start content-tagger rails plus a minimal backend stack
content-tagger$ govuk-docker run-this backend

# Start content-publisher rails plus an end-to-end stack
content-publisher$ govuk-docker run-this e2e
```

The above examples make use of an alias to reduce the amount of typing; the full form is `govuk-docker run-this`. In the last two commands, the app will be available in your browser at *app-name.dev.gov.uk*.

## User Needs

The aim of govuk-docker is to meet the following primary need.

> **As a** developer on GOV.UK apps <br/>
> **I want** a GOV.UK environment optimised for development <br/>
> **So that** I can develop GOV.UK apps efficiently

However, this high-level statement hides a great number of specific needs, which also help to clarify the design decisions for govuk-docker. These lower-level [needs](docs/NEEDS.md) and associated [decisions](docs/DECISIONS.md) are set out in separate documents.

## Setup

### 1. Dependencies

First make sure the following are installed on your system:

1. [dnsmasq](http://www.thekelleys.org.uk/dnsmasq/doc.html) to make *app-name.dev.gov.uk* work (`brew install dnsmasq`)
2. [docker](https://hub.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. [git](https://git-scm.com) if you're setting everything up from scratch
4. A directory `~/govuk` in your home directory

### 2. Configure shell

Start with the following in your `~/.bash_profile`:

```
export PATH=$PATH:~/govuk/govuk-docker/bin
```

Reload your shell with `source ~/.bash_profile`.

### 3. Configure DNS

Then create or append to the following and restart dnsmasq.

```
# /etc/resolver/dev.gov.uk
nameserver 127.0.0.1

# /usr/local/etc/dnsmasq.conf (bottom)
address=/dev.gov.uk/127.0.0.1
```

### 4. Clone repo and build

Now in the `govuk` directory, run the following commands.

```
git clone git@github.com:alphagov/govuk-docker.git
cd govuk-docker

# Expect this to take some time (around 20 minutes)
make
```

## FAQs

### How to: diagnose and troubleshoot

Sometimes things go wrong or some investigation is needed. As govuk-docker is just a bunch of docker config and a CLI wrapper, it's still possible to use all the standard docker commands to help fix issues and get more info e.g.

```
# tail logs for running services
govuk-docker logs -f

# get all the running containers
docker ps -a

# get a terminal inside a service
govuk-docker run-this default bash
```

### How to: add a new service

Here's an example commit that does just that.

https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/commit/1cd31a5fa3469cce47637db81f17ca1b03d72f89

### How to: change a service e.g. upgrade Ruby

This will usually involve editing a `Dockerfile`, for things like system packages or new language versions; or a `docker-compose.yml` file, for things like environment variables and dependencies on other services. When a `Dockerfile` changes, the associated image needs to be rebuilt, which can be done in the service directory by running `gdb`.

### How to: setup a specific service

If a new service has been added to govuk-docker, first pull the latest version to get the changes. One way to setup the new service would be to run `make`, but this goes through every service and might take a while. A faster way is to do this:

```
# auto-clone any new services
make clone

# setup the specific service(s)
make -f my_service/Makefile
```

### How to: update everything!

Sometimes it's useful to get all changes for all repos e.g. to support finding things with a govuk-wide grep. This can be done by running `make pull`, followed by `make setup` to ensure all services continue to run as expected.
